# Movie Watch List
This project is used for storing and checking off the movies you're planning on seeing in 2018. You can access the deployed version at https://secret-sands-12749.herokuapp.com/

## How to get started:
If you're looking to use the application please clone the repo to your computer and run "npm install" from the command line in the repo folder that contains your package.json file. After that is complete, you will need to adjust the information in connection.js to connect the application to your own database(mysql) if you wish to test the application in a local setting. 

When you're ready to launch the application, type "node server.js" in the terminal from the repo directory. 
You should see that your connection has been started on port "number" and you can now navigate to this port in your browser to access the application.
